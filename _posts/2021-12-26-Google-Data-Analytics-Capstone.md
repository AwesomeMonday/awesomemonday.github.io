Hello, this is Hao. I have recently completed my Google data analytics certificate courses, and I chose to move forward with the Cyclistic Bike-Share for my case study. I followed the six steps that was taught in the course (ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, ACT). Below I will share my thought process on how I processed and what I understood from the given tasks.


## COMPANY BACKGROUND

Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago. The company offers traditional bikes, also reclining bikes, had tricycles, and cargo bikes to the people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes, about 8% of riders use the assistive options. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime, since they have more than 692 stations across Chicago.
Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. The company offers 2 types of passes, and the customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual rides, customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
