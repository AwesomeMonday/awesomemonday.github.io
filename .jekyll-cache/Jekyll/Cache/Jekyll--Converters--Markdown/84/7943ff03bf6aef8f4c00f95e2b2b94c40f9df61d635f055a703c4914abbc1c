I" <p>Hello, this is Hao. I have recently completed my Google data analytics certificate courses, and I chose to move forward with the Cyclistic Bike-Share for my case study. I followed the six steps that was taught in the course (ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, ACT). Below I will share my thought process on how I processed and what I understood from the given tasks.</p>

<h2 id="company-background">COMPANY BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago. The company offers traditional bikes, along with reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes to the people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes, about 8% of riders use the assistive options. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime, since they have more than 692 stations across Chicago.</p>

<p>Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. The company offers 2 types of passes, and the customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual rides, customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.</p>

<h2 id="business-task">BUSINESS TASK</h2>

<p>The director of marketing Lily Moreno, believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. My team needs to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. We need to understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect our marketing tactics. Then she will present the findings to the executive team for final approval.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-the-data">PREPARE THE DATA</h2>

<p>I have downloaded the past 12 months data (January 2021 to December 2021) from the given link: <a href="http://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">Cyclistic Trip Data</a>. According to the case study material, the data has been made available by Motivate International Inc., the license information can be found <a href="https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">here</a>.</p>

<p>The data provides information on the starting and ending time and station names, for each ride trip, also indicates the customer types (members or casuals), I can use them to answer the business questions.</p>

<h4 id="problem-with-the-data">Problem with the data:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The data has some missing fields, most of them are the start and end stations information, I will need to consult with my manager, but I will remove all the rows with missing fields for my analysis for the time being.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can’t tell if there are any return customers from the given data, since there are no customer identifying fields.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some trip station names with the word “base”, “repair”, “checking”, I will remove these trips since they don’t provide me with relative insights.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="process-and-clean-the-data">PROCESS AND CLEAN THE DATA</h2>

<p>I have made copies of the original data and saved it at a different location for back up, then I loaded the data into RStudio for cleaning and initial analysis.</p>

<p>The reason I those RStudio over Microsoft Excel was simply based on the size of the dataset, since there are well over 1 million rows.
The code for data processing and cleaning can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/haoli10/google-data-analytics-capstone-project/notebook">Kaggle</a>.</p>

<h4 id="load-the-data-into-rstudio">LOAD THE DATA INTO RSTUDIO</h4>

<p>After viewing the original data, the first thing I noticed was there are empty fields, so I decided to use read_csv, and its NA argument, so we can work with the NA values at a later time.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/Google-Cyclistic/load-in-data.png" alt="load in data" /></p>

<p>Then I ran glimpse function on all the datasets to make sure all of them have the same number of columns, and all the columns are in the same data types across the 12 sets.</p>

<p>I used rbind function to combine all 12 datasets into one, and named it full_trip. After running another glimpse function, the new dataset still has 13 columns, which is consistent with the original datasets, and with more than 5 million rows.</p>

<h4 id="data-cleaning">DATA CLEANING</h4>

<p>Checked for empty rows and columns, and removed all the rows that contains NA, and named the new dataset full_trip_v1.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/Google-Cyclistic/remove-na.png" alt="remove na" /></p>

<p>I then created time variables such as month, week_day, hour and ride_length using the lubridate functions and also removed any ride trips with the ride_length less than 1 minute, and more than 1440 minutes, which is more than 24 hours. Renamed the new dataset full_trip_time.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/Google-Cyclistic/time-variables.png" alt="time variables" /></p>

<p>Removed all the ride trips which the bikes were taken in for maintenance and repair, renamed full_trip_cleaned. Finally checked to see if there are any rows with the duplicate ride_id.</p>
