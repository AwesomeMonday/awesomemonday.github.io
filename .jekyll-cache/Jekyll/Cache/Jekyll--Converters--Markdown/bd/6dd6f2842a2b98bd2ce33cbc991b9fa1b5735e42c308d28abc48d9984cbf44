I"0<p>Hello, this is Hao.</p>

<p>On May 17th 2022, the coronavirus has taken more than 1 million lives in the United States alone, you can read this article from NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/05/17/1093651037/us-one-million-deaths" target="_blank">here</a>. I wanted to see what we have learned about the virus and how it’s affecting different countries in the world, so I downloaded the data set from <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data" target="_blank">ourworldindata’s github page</a>.</p>
