I"z<p>Hello, this is Hao. I have recently completed my Google data analytics certificate courses, and I chose to move forward with the Cyclistic Bike-Share for my case study. I followed the six steps that was taught in the course (ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, ACT). Below I will share my thought process on how I processed and what I understood from the given tasks.</p>
